# RFM-Analysis

An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. I first defined the behavior of customers using RFM analysis and created groups according to clusters in these behaviors. Customers that exhibited common behaviors were put in the same groups. The e-commerce company could develop unique marketing strategies for distinct groups based on the result of the analysis.

RFM is a marketing analysis tool used for analyzing customer value based on their spending habits. RFM stands for the three dimensions:
- Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
- Frequency – How often do they purchase?
- Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

RFM has the advantage of no specialized statistical software required and the results are readily understood by non-technical people.
